# Cereals-Dataset
Application of Regression Technique to Cereals dataset. Development of Healthiness metric to assess the cereal brands.
In the Cereals dataset:
  First, I have applied Random Forest Regression technique to predict the Rating received by the products. 
  Second, I have calculated a Healthiness metric which divides the healthy features(that need to be more in the products) of a product by unhealthy features(that need to be less in the products)
